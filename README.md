# upgrade_all_python
This program will upgrade every libraries you have installed/which are preinstalled belonging to python
A windows user may try to upgrade python using the executable program itself but we should be sure that we run it as an admininstrator if the python we are upgrading is installed for all users
The python program will work normally but in the case for windows it has to be run in an elevated powershell or command line to be able to access the python folder and files if installed using the option "install for all users " .
