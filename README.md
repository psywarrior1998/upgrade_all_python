An intelligent, feature-rich CLI tool to manage and upgrade Python packages with a clean, modern interface and a powerful dependency safety-net.

## Key Features

  - **üõ°Ô∏è Atomic Upgrades with Rollback**: If an upgrade fails for any reason (e.g., compilation error, network issue), the tool automatically reverts the package to its previous stable version. This ensures your environment is never left in a broken state.
  - **üîé Intelligent Dependency Analysis**: Performs a pre-flight check using `pip` to detect and warn you about potential dependency conflicts *before* you upgrade.
  - **‚ö° Concurrent & Fast**: Upgrades packages in parallel using a configurable number of workers, dramatically reducing the time you spend waiting.
  - **üìä Rich & Interactive UI**: Uses `rich` to display outdated packages in a clean, readable table with clear progress bars and status updates.
  - **üéØ Selective Upgrades**: Upgrade all packages at once, or specify exactly which packages to include or exclude from an upgrade operation.
  - **‚õëÔ∏è Safety First**: Includes a `--dry-run` mode to see what would be upgraded without making any changes to your environment.
  - **ü§ñ Automation Friendly**: A `--yes` flag allows for non-interactive use in automated scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

The tool is available on PyPI. Install it with pip:

```bash
pip install ultimate-python-upgrader
```

## Usage

Once installed, the `py-upgrade` command will be available.

**1. Check for outdated packages and upgrade all interactively**

```bash
py-upgrade
```

**2. Upgrade specific packages**

```bash
py-upgrade requests numpy
```

**3. Upgrade all packages except a few**

```bash
py-upgrade --exclude black ruff
```

**4. Perform a dry run to see what needs upgrading**

```bash
py-upgrade --dry-run
```

**5. Run non-interactively for automation**

```bash
py-upgrade --yes
```

**6. Increase concurrency for faster upgrades**

```bash
py-upgrade --workers 20
```
